JCROP BUILD FOLDER
------------------

The files in this folder are used by git and .git/hooks/pre-commit script.
Unless you are developing with Jcrop and git, you can ignore what's here.

If you would like to use this as a pre-commit hook, I have included the
pre-commit hook that I use named pre-commit.bash

If you can use bash, copy this file to .git/hooks/pre-commit and make it
executable. Your milage may vary!
